# Prototypes
The various Python modules in this repository are partly dependent and partly indipendent on one another. They contain all the Python code I program during my thesis on Delaunay Refinement of smooth surface domains embadded into 3-dimensional space.

Dependencies:
- [pythonOCC](http://www.pythonocc.org)
- [pytriangle](https://github.com/pletzer/pytriangle)
- [pyglet](http://pyglet.org)
- [PyMesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
